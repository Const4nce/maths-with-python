\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

\begin{document}

This is a basic document.

See
how
the
effect of   different           spacings

works; or not?

\textbf{Note the use} of \textit{different} \texttt{styles} of
text. Use them \textsc{as little} as possible.

Note also
\begin{itemize}
\item how anything ``special'' starts ``\verb|\|'',
\item how quote characters behave (compare with ''this''),
\item how curly braces \verb|{| and \verb|}| are used without
  appearing,
\item and how \emph{environments} always \verb|\begin| and
    \verb|\end|.
\end{itemize}


\section{Sections split up your document}
\label{sec:TopSection}


\subsection{Subsections are also useful}
\label{sec:SubSection}

Note that different \LaTeX\ classes (\texttt{article}, \texttt{book},
etc.) allow for different sectioning commands.
